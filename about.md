### Biography
I am a **Project Scientist at the Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory**, specializing in **advanced electron microscopy for energy materials** and the **automation of microscopy characterization**. My research bridges the gap between atomic‑scale computational modeling and high‑resolution experimental techniques.


During my PhD, I focused on connecting **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** and **Monte Carlo simulations** with experimental **STEM and EELS** studies, developing models that describe thermodynamic and transport properties in energy materials. This work cultivated my passion for combining **computation, characterization, and automation** to advance materials science.


### Expertise
- Aberration‑corrected STEM imaging
- Electron energy‑loss spectroscopy (EELS)
- X‑ray and in‑situ characterization
- Data analysis & automation toolkits
- Computational modeling (DFT, thermodynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo)


### Research Philosophy
My approach integrates **microscopy, computation, and automation** to enable autonomous materials discovery and design. By coupling machine learning and robotics with electron microscopy, I aim to transform how we characterize and engineer complex energy and semiconductor systems.

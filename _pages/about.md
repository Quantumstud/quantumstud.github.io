I am a graduate student under the Singapore (NUS) â€“ MIT Alliance for Research and Technology ([SMART](https://smart.mit.edu/){:target="\_blank"}). I am affiliated to the [department of Material Science and Engineering of NUS](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/mse/){:target="\_blank"}. My broad area of interest is the synergistic investigation of materials using atomically resolved microscopy and computational materials science. In 2018, I completed my undergraduate studies in Materials at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISc, Bangalore).
